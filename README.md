# tic-tac-toe
Play a game of tic tac toe!
Additional Features:
  - Change player names
  - start / restart game

## Learning Outcomes
- Created an "enum" for gamestate! I wonder how other implementation returned gamestate to display controller. I will do some research on other solutions!
- First time using modules and factories. I am glad I finally learned how to organize code outside of global scope in Javascript
- Practiced model view controller design pattern (separating logic, UI, and data strcutures). I feel like im in CMPT 213 again haha. Lotsa fun
  - Relearning how to design separate components that are able to work together!
